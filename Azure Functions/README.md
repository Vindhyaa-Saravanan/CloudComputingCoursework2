# Evaluation of Python Runtimes on Commercial vs Open-source Serverless Platforms

## Overview

This repository contains the code, scripts, and documentation for my COMP5123M Cloud Computing Coursework 2. The coursework involves experimenting with commercial and open-source serverless platforms, implementing functions, analyzing performance, and documenting findings.  

## Repository Contents

- ðŸ“‚ **Azure Functions/** â€“ Contains all Azure function implementations.  
- ðŸ“‚ **OpenFaas/** â€“ Contains all OpenFaaS function implementations.  

## Research Report

### Q1: General Information

1) Commercial serverless platform: **Microsoft Azure Functions** 

   Why: Azure Functions offers seamless integration with Azure services, automatic scaling, and a variety of supported languages, making it suitable for cloud-native applications.

2) Open-source serverless platform: **OpenFaaS** 
   
   Why: OpenFaaS provides flexibility in hosting functions on any infrastructure, allowing users to manage their serverless environment while maintaining full control over function execution and scaling.

3) Programming Language: **Python** 
   
   Why: Python is widely used in machine learning, data science, and serverless applications due to its simplicity, extensive libraries, and support in cloud platforms like Azure Functions and OpenFaaS.

4) Application description:
